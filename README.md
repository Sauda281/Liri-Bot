Liri is like the iPhone siri. However, while siri is a speech reconition interface, liri is a language recognition and interpretation command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data. This Liri uses Spotify Api to search for songs, Bands in Town Api to search for concerts and OMDB Api to search for movies
